## Chapter Feedback

**Instructions:**
Once you have been confirmed as a student reviewer for a chapter, please read the chapter thoroughly and explore the resources. We want your feedback to be based on the stand-alone chapter content and not necessarily how the chapters are packaged or other features of the "book". After you have had a chance to read through and explore the chapter, complete the form below in markdown, placing your responses directly underneath each question. Please be thoughtful and constructive in your responses so that we can improve the resources for future students. 

In order for you to submit your feedback, please use the following format for the Issue Title directly above: `[your name] review of [chapter name]`. For example, `Paul Pickell review of Mapping Data`.
